# `$ whois david`?
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at TUDelft in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 . I hold a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 .

* I like to write code, particularly in Python and JavaScript. But I can write in many other languages confidently, too. 👨‍💻
* I co-authored [*Tango with Django*](https://www.tangowithdjango.com), so you may be able to tell I have a particular interest in web technologies. 📖
* I like to build and engineer software from the ground up, and think about how different components fit together. I helped engineer a prototype system at Microsoft, and [it got patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10102199B2/)! So I must be good at that. 🏗️
* I *really* like drawing pictures in Adobe Illustrator, and visualising complex things with Illustrator, too. 🎨
* I like to [do science](https://www.dmax.org.uk/thesis/), specifically when looking at how people behave and interact with search engines. 🧪
* I also like teaching and doing talks about things, whether it be about my research, or about more squishy things in life, like my experiences of doing *x, y or z*. It's good to share! 👨‍🏫

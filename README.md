# `$ whois david`?
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at TUDelft in the 🇳🇱 Netherlands. I hold a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow in 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland.

* I like to write code, particularly in Python and JavaScript. But I can write in many other languages confidently, too.
* I co-authored [*Tango with Django*](https://www.tangowithdjango.com), so you may be able to tell I have a particular interest in web technologies.
* I like to build and engineer software from the ground up, and think about how different components fit together. I helped engineer a prototype system at Microsoft, and [it got patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10102199B2/)! So I must be good at that.
* I *really* like drawing pictures in Adobe Illustrator, and visualising complex things with Illustrator, too.
* I like to [do science](https://www.dmax.org.uk/thesis/), specifically when looking at how people behave and interact with search engines.

You can see more about me (and reach out to me!) on my website at [dmax.org.uk](https://www.dmax.org.uk). Cheers!

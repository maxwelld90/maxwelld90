# David Maxwell 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at TUDelft in the 🇳🇱 Netherlands. I hold a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow in 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland.

I like to write code, particularly in Python and JavaScript. But I can write in many other languages confidently, too. I co-authored [*Tango with Django*](https://www.tangowithdjango.com), so you may be able to tell I have a particular interest in web technologies. I like to build and engineer software from the ground up, and think about how different components fit together. I really like drawing pictures and visualising data in Illustrator. I like to do science, specifically looking at how people behave and interact with search engines.

You can see more about me (and reach out to me!) on my website at [dmax.org.uk](https://www.dmax.org.uk). Cheers!
